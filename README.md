# Multicountry_Wildfire_EHE_Child_Hosp

This is the repository for the central code used in the study of compound effects of extreme heat events and substantial wildfire particle pollution on cause-specific child hospitalization, across multiple countries. Specifically:

- The 'Modelling.R' file contains the central code for the time-series analysis (e.g., RR and RERI calculation)
- The 'Main figure.R' file contains the code for creating main figures
- The 'Figure2_3.xlsx' contains the data directly used to generate Figure 2 & Figure 3
- The 'Figure2_4.xlsx' contains the data directly used to generate Figure 2 & Figure 4
- The 'Figure5.csv' contains the data directly used to generate Figure 5

To note, Figure 1 was created using ArcMap; therefore, no reproducible code is available for that figure.
